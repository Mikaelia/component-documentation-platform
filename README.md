# React Documentation System, and Component Library

This project was an exploration in how to create my own component library, bundle it, publish it to NPM, and document it via a platform that I created from scratch. 

Package can be viewed here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/component-library-mikaelia

And installed via:
```
npm install component-library
```


Design inspired by React-Toolkit and MaterialUI
